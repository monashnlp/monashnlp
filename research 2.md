# Research
MonashNLP research is focused on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly in low-level perception and high-level reasoning under uncertainty, mainly from text and potentially from other data modalities, including
- Neuro-Symbolic AI Agents, e.g. integrating LLMs and symbolic methods for multi-modal agents that operate/learn by perception, planning, acting, and feeback
- Machine Learning, e.g. deep generative models, Bayesian learning and inference, deep causal models, explainable AI, deep reinforcement learning
- Knowledge Graphs and LLMs, e.g. effective approaches for hybrid LLM-KG reasoning, certifying LLM knwoledge/reasoning
- Efficient and effective LLMs, e.g. better architectures, better decoding/inference, better training algorithms (long-context LLMs, KV-caching)
- Continual Learning, e.g. LLM knwoledge editing, retreival augmented generation (RAG)
- Reliable and Safe LLMs, e.g. alignment algorithms (RLHF), social-cultural norms, jailbreaking and defence mechanisms
- Multilingual and Multimodal Foundation Models, e.g. covering low-resource languages, speech/video/text/code modalities
- Real-life Applications, e.g. text/speech/document translation, question-answering, coding, dialogue systems
